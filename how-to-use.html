	<p>The diagram below is the work of Abdul Sattar s.o Sardar Ali<br>
	and Imran Nazir s.o Mohammed Nazir. The diagram was not constructed to<br>
	appear as what you might expect a family tree to look like. This is because<br>
	the conventional tree structure we are familiar with does not show inter-marriages<br>
	very well; and since most people simply want to see how they are related to<br>
	each other; a web structure is more suitable.</p>
	<p>The diagram shows Mian Ramzaneh as the largest blue dot. Connected to him<br>
	are his two sons, Mian Bhawal & Mian Sohana and all their descendants<br>
	Each dot is a person in either blue or red. These being male or female.</p>
	<p>Hover your mouse pointer over dot and you will see the name. If you want<br>
	to search for a particular person, use the search bar at the top. Move your mouse<br>
	pointer over one of the suggested possibilities and a dot in the diagram will be highlighted.<br>
	You can also zoom using you mousewheel or the zoom bar on the left edge. Once<br>
	you zoom in quite far all the names of the dots will become visible.<br>
	You will then see a small red box within the box in the bottom right corner.<br>
	left-click and hold the red box and move it around. You can now navigate the main<br>
	diagram through it.</p>
